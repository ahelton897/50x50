Ruth Asawa insisted that the whole of her life experience was a work of art. Like a bulb in the ground, she felt that she was growing and that she should be doing something every second that she was attached to this earth. Ruth Asawa insisted that the whole of her life experience was a work of art. Like a bulb in the ground, she felt that she was growing and that she should be doing something every second that she was attached to this earth. Born in 1926 in Norwalk, California, a small agricultural town in Los Angeles County, she was the fourth of seven children. Her family worked in sugar beets and leased a “truck farm” in Norwalk until 1942 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order No. 9066 authorizing the internment of more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent during World War II. Asawa had earned praise for drawing at a young age, and continued drawing under the mentorship of professional artists in the internment camps.

Black Mountain College, where Asawa began experimenting with galvanized wire as an artistic medium, influenced her whole approach to making art. By the late 1950s, she established a signature abstract style working in crocheted wire and became the first Asian-American woman to earn recognition in the male-dominated field of postwar modern sculpture. Asawa and her husband Albert Lanier, an architect whom she met at Black Mountain, raised six children in San Francisco, California where she also became one of the City’s foremost advocates for arts education. The Ruth Asawa San Francisco School for the Arts is a public arts high school that grew out of her tireless campaign to support arts programming that would empower children and communities, beginning with an experimental arts workshop at Alvarado Elementary School that Asawa co-founded with art historian Sally Woodbridge in 1968.

Asawa studied at Black Mountain College for three years, from 1946 to 1948, working closely with Joseph Albers and Buckminster Fuller. She says, "Black Mountain gave you the right to do any anything you wanted to do. And then you put a label on it afterward. I think that's the nice thing about what Black Mountain did for its students. They gave you permission to do anything you wanted to do. And if it didn't fit, they'd make a category for you."

Similarly, Albers taught Asawa that all materials have potential to do something that they have not yet done. By choosing a material and working with it repeatedly and with discipline, she could begin to abstract it from its historical context to discover new possibilities of form and function. Whereas, Fuller taught abstraction as an approach to playful experimentation with the materials and patterns that one sees in nature. From these teachings and her own observations of the natural world, especially early childhood memories of her family's farm, Asawa understood that the process of abstraction required that she become background to an emerging work of art rather than force her preconceived ideas into it.
