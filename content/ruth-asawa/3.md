Asawa initially learned how to crochet with wire by visiting with basket makers in Toluca, Mexico while on a summer break from Black Mountain College in 1947.

Traditionally the baskets were used to sell eggs and produce in street markets. Inspired by Albers and Fuller, Asawa began working with the material in a more abstract way, as a line that could interlock, interweave, and go anywhere in space-such that she could draw and sculpt simultaneously.

Asawa grew her reputation in the art world in the early 1950s with a series of critically acclaimed shows featuring her crocheted wire forms at Peridot Gallery in New York City. The exposure prompted invitations to participate in annual exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art as well as the 1955 SÃ£o Paulo Biennale. The Group of Architectural Works in the collection of the San Jose Museum of Art, a gift from Ruth Asawa in honor of the Museum's 35th Anniversary, is exemplary of the "long-lobed" hourglass forms that she produced in the 1950s. She took special care in creating the proportions of the connected interlocking spheres, starting with the smaller ones on the inside and then working to form an outside layer.
