Asawa studied at Black Mountain College for three years, from 1946 to 1948, working closely with Joseph Albers and Buckminster Fuller.

She says, "Black Mountain gave you the right to do any anything you wanted to do. And then you put a label on it afterward. I think that's the nice thing about what Black Mountain did for its students. They gave you permission to do anything you wanted to do. And if it didn't fit, they'd make a category for you."

Similarly, Albers taught Asawa that all materials have potential to do something that they have not yet done. By choosing a material and working with it repeatedly and with discipline, she could begin to abstract it from its historical context to discover new possibilities of form and function. Whereas, Fuller taught abstraction as an approach to playful experimentation with the materials and patterns that one sees in nature. From these teachings and her own observations of the natural world, especially early childhood memories of her family's farm, Asawa understood that the process of abstraction required that she become background to an emerging work of art rather than force her preconceived ideas into it.
