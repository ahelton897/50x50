Bischoff observed the dissolution of form in light such that the edges were barely discernable.

Painting figures in a room or landscape required clusters of dense and gestural brushwork that showed the activity of light washing over them. Two Women in Vermillion Light, in which the branch of a tree is suspended above and in arm's reach of two figures, presents the aliveness of an outdoor space with a warm kind of glow. The reddish orange vermillion palette is muddied by greens, browns, and blues. It is a deliberately sought-after impurity. "Indeed, some of his paintings expressed feelings of severe anxiety and dread. Several works from 1955 are so dark that the figures are barely discernable, even while depicting innocuous daylight subjects," says Susan Landauer, a long-time colleague of Bischoff and former chief curator at the San Jos√© Museum of Art. Yet, the contrasting light of an illumined blossom and the profile of a radiant young woman give fresh vitality to this painterly scene. "Blurred into intangibility, almost to the extent that it seems an hallucination, it nonetheless remains undeniably real," says art historian Donald Kuspit. Bischoff was intent to represent both the inner life of his figures and the physical worldly sensations that are fundamental to being human.
