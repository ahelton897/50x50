Paul Mills curated a definitive exhibition of Bay Area expressionistic figurative painting at the Oakland Museum of California in 1957.

The show centered around the work of three prominent painters-David Park, Elmer Bischoff, and Richard Diebenkorn-who had taught at the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) and grown bored of Abstract Expressionism as a form of radical intervention following World War II. Their work was complemented by nine others working in a figurative style, including: Joseph Brooks, Theophilus Brown, Robert Downs, Bruce McGaw, Robert Qualters, Walter Snelgrove, Henry Villierme, James Weeks, and Paul Wonner.

In 1956, under the leadership of Gurdon Woods, figurative painting had become the new official style of SFAI. Students could paint any subject that they desired, as long as they abided by the expressionistic belief in the value of painting as process and, in the words of Bischoff, its power to "pierce through all generalities to some particular poignancy of feeling."

Bischoff's return to SFAI in 1956 as the head of a new graduate program positioned him as a bridge between the figurative painters who had resigned in 1952 in protest of then director Ernest Mundt's administrative policies, namely Park and himself, and those that Bischoff recruited to join him when Woods took over, notably Diebenkorn (former faculty at SFAI who had earlier left on his own accord), Nathan Oliveira, and Frank Lobdell. SFAI fostered a second generation of figurative painters in the Bay Area that included Joan Brown and Manuel Neri.
